ML enhancement to original driving

Mode - Time Attack

I/O


I - throttle
I - brake
I - steer
I - gear
I - track segment
I - distance raced
I - current lap time
I - previous lap time
I - map

O - Modified throtling based on enhancement
O - Modified braking based on enhancement
O - Modified steering  based on enhancement
O - Modified gearing  based on enhancement
O - lines taken so far

Logic

Check current lap time
if lap time previous faster than current time - time to the start line
get segment information
get turn information
ENHANCE - modify steering to place car more on the outside before the corner entry
ENHANCE - if turn is more than n degrees to brake a little harder
ENHANCE - modify steering to make car get closer to the apex during the turn
ENHANCE - modify throttle to get as close to the limit of the g-g diagram as possible
ENHANCE - modify steering to place car more on the outside after corner exit
