# autonomousdrivingUoD

An implementation of an autonomous formula racing car using laser sensors for navigation.
The onboard view serves as the monocular SLAM input for vision.

TODO

Implement 2nd camera for binocular SLAM
Vehicle commands come from the game:
  - Implement actuation control (throttle, brake, steering) to come from SLAM algorithm.
  - TBA
